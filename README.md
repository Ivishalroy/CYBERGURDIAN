⚠️ Disclaimer
CyberGuardian AI is your friendly cyber sidekick, not an omnipotent protector. It spots threats, catches deepfakes, and scares off digital gremlins 🐉, but it can’t guarantee you’ll never click something you shouldn’t. We process inputs safely and never store sensitive data—remember, the strongest firewall is your brain 🧠.
